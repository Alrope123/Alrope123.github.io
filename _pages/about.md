Hello!

I am a first-year PhD student at UIUC. I am a formal Predoctoral Young Investigator at Allen Institute for AI mentored by <a href='https://pdasigi.github.io/'>Pradeep Dasigi. I received my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science at <a href='https://www.cs.washington.edu'>Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering</a> at <a href='http://www.washington.edu/'>University of Washington-Seattle</a>, where I was mentored by <a href='https://shmsw25.github.io/'>Sewon Min</a> and <a href='https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/index.html'>Hannaneh Hajishirzi</a>.

My current research focus on learning, characterizing, and improving Large Language Models in stages of data, pretraining, and inference.

My Chinese name is written as 吕欣禧, which embodys the meaning of happiness:grin:.
