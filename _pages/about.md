Hello!

I am a 5th Year Master student at <a href='https://www.cs.washington.edu'>Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering</a> at <a href='http://www.washington.edu/'>University of Washington-Seattle</a>. I am studying in natural language processing and machine learning, mentored by <a href='https://shmsw25.github.io/'>Sewon Min</a> in <a href='https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/index.html'>Hannaneh Hajishirzi</a>'s group. My current research focus on few-shot learning.

I received my B.S.in Computer Science at UW in December, 2021.

My Chinese name is written as 吕欣禧, which embodys the meaning of happiness:grin:.
